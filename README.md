# A-Data-Driven-Study-of-Aviation-Accidents-Fatalities-and-Safety-Trends
This project analyzed historical aviation accident data from the Aviation Safety Network (1919–2023) using Python. The dataset was cleaned, validated, and examined to study long-term safety trends, key historical periods, accident severity, and changes in accident types, focusing on trends and historical interpretation rather than absolute risk.

STRUCTURE

csv/: raw and cleaned dataset
source/: Python scripts for data cleaning, validation, and analysis
study/: final report and supporting materials

USAGE

Run the Python scripts in the source folder.
All analyses and figures used in the report are generated directly from these scripts.

The project is intended for exploratory and academic purposes, with emphasis on data analysis rather than software development.
If you are interested in the results and interpretations, the full study is available in the study/ folder — it provides a clear and engaging overview of the findings and is definitely worth checking out.
